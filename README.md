2. Install Docker or other compatible software (e.g. Rancher)
3. Install the Dev Containers extension

For detailed instructions, visit [Dev Containers tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/tutorial)

Note that the dev container in this project is based off of the one mentioned in [Create a Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/create-dev-container)

1. Clone this project
2. Open this project in Visual Studio Code
